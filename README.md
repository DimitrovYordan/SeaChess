# SeaChess

Made new game SeaChess, not ready yet. The playing field is ready, the players and their characters are ready, they can make their moves.

I need to figure out how to save the previous move and print with the new one, how to move the box to only print on the right, how to make the box only show once after each players move.

Printing of old and new moves - solved.

The playing field sits on the right and the points on the left.

The playing field is refreshed after each move.

Add some color
